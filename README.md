# Maze Generator
## https://maze-generator.shephardluke.co.uk
A showcase of a random maze generator using a backtracking algorithm.

Made using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

# How to use
Drag the complexity slider to change how complex the maze should be, then press the regenerate button to regenerate the maze.

# Notes
I made this just to learn how maze generation algoritms work. It is one of my smaller programs with under 200 lines, so maybe I could make it into something bigger one day.
